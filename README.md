# Casper Copy Cat

### Description

- This was another starter HMTL/CSS project. This assignment was to make a copy-cat of the casper.com homr page.
- My version can be viewed at https://sun-bear.netlify.app/

### What I Learned:

- On this project I was able to implement some more advanced CSS Flex Box design patterns
- I was able to make a fully functionally slide in mobile nav menu from some jQuery
- I also integrated two instances of a jQuery slider/carousel with bx-slider
- I learned how to work with SVG graphics

### What I am Proud Of:

- As a copy cat I project I feel I really hit a home run with this one. 
- If any one from Casper HR is looking, please give me a call.


### How I Would Uplevel It:

- I could look at the code and DRY it out some.
